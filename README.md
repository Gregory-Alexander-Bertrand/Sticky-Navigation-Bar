A navigation bar that sticks to the top of the screen when a user scrolls down.
After a certain point in the window, the colors on the navigation bar change.
When the user scrolls back up to the top, the colors change back to their original preset.
Project influenced/learned from Brad Traversy and his Udemy Course.
